## What's new in 2.3

The 2.3.0 driver is a minor release with few new features. The most notable is discussed below.

## Support for .NET Core

You can now use the .NET driver with .NET Core.

The Nuget packages target two versions of the .NET frameworks: net45 and netstandard1.5. The net45 target allows the driver to be used with the full .NET Framework 
version 4.5 and later, and the netstandard1.5 target allows the driver to be used with any framework that supports netstandard1.5, which includes .NET Core 1.0.
