## Welcome to the .NET MongoDB Driver Documentation

The [Getting Started]({{< relref "getting_started\index.md" >}}) guide contains information about system requirements, installation, and a simple tutorial to get up and running quickly.


## What's new in 2.3

The [What's New]({{< relref "what_is_new.md" >}}) section contains the major new features of the driver.

The main new feature is support for .NET Core.

The Nuget packages target two versions of the .NET frameworks: net45 and netstandard1.5. The net45 target allows the driver to be used with the full .NET Framework 
version 4.5 and later, and the netstandard1.5 target allows the driver to be used with any framework that supports netstandard1.5, which includes .NET Core 1.0.


## Upgrading

If you are coming from the 2.0.x series of the driver, consult the [upgrading]({{< relref "upgrading.md" >}}) documentation on changes.


## Reference

If you are looking for more detailed documentation, see the [Reference]({{< relref "reference\index.md" >}}) guide.
